# Healthcare


Healthcare system that tracks your diseases and gives you insight reports along with ML model to test disease with symptoms.

Problem Statement: When it comes to health care, there is not very much awareness in our country. People don’t really take in account their past ailments or injuries, treatments and sometimes not even their allergies. This sometimes leads to serious health hazards even after seeking proper professional medical guidance. The doctors usually go through with the patient regarding their allergies and illnesses, but since that is based on the limited memorization capacity of the brain affected by trauma or anxiety due to the illness chances are some important information may be missed. 
Not just this, people also sometimes ignore permanent symptoms that might be some serious disease and due to lack of information and loss of time the disease which was once curable might turn into a lifelong trauma.

Methodology:

We plan on making a portal that will perform the following functions:
Generates medical history reports based on entries by users regarding their previous illnesses, treatments, allergies and what medications do not suit them so that when needed by medical professionals can be used and proper help can be provided.
Based on the permanent symptoms entered by the user and their previous medical history we can predict whether or not they have a certain disease and can seek medical professional’s help in time.
When feeling something unusual, users can access a variety of diseases, enter their symptoms and check whether they have it and whether they need professional help  or not.


Objectives: The primary objective behind this project is to make people more aware about health care and to help medical practitioners with providing best treatment according to the patients health records. Also this project can be extended to professional usage with mini pilot projects to actually help out citizens.
